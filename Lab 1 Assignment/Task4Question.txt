Q1:
HSV is typically better than RGB because the HSV color model is more intuitive to human vision while the RGB color model is preferred by display hardware.For HSV values,
I pick color of Pink. The lower bound is [20,100,100] and the upper bound is [40,255,255]

Q2:
Yes there is a distinct difference in the tracking ability of my object. When the light is on, your object is trackable as lights of the object reflects to the webcam, 
and when the turn is off, the intensity of your reflected light is not strong enough which result in lost tracking the object. When I turn on my phone flashlight on the 
object, the object also no longer trackable as the reflected light become too strong and it is no longer reflecting the color of itself

Q3:
The brigtness of my phone would affect my code to track the object because of the intensity of the reflected light of the object.

Q4:
The answer I got is that phone is more robost to brigtness in comparsion to non-phone object.
